# Vertical ListView layout

### Task

1. Fix the errors in the provided code to render a vertical layout of 3 indpendent `ListView`s, as shown the video below.

2. Figure out *why* this problem arises, and gain an in-depth understanding of [fluttter layout constraints](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/constraints). Include this explaination in the video you send to us.

### Code 

Run the following code -

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(),
        body: Column(
          children: [
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
              Column(
                children: [
                  Text(
                    "Set ${i}",
                    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline6,
                  ),
                  Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                    child: ListView(
                      children: [
                        for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++)
                          Center(
                            child: Text("{${i}, ${j}}"),
                          ),
                      ],
                    ),
                  ),
                ],
              ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

It should give you the following error - 

```
======== Exception caught by rendering library =====================================================
The following assertion was thrown during performResize():
Vertical viewport was given unbounded height.

Viewports expand in the scrolling direction to fill their container. In this case, a vertical viewport was given an unlimited amount of vertical space in which to expand. This situation typically happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget.

If this widget is always nested in a scrollable widget there is no need to use a viewport because there will always be enough vertical space for the children. In this case, consider using a Column instead. Otherwise, consider using the "shrinkWrap" property (or a ShrinkWrappingViewport) to size the height of the viewport to the sum of the heights of its children.

The relevant error-causing widget was: 
  ListView ListView:file:///Users/dev/Projects/dara/dara-client/lib/main_null_safe.dart:26:28
