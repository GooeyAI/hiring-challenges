## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the Dara hiring challenges.

We're a deeply technology focused company, and expect our engineers to be able to  deeply understand the languages they work with. 

To assess your understanding of the tools and technologies used at Dara, we've crafted a series of challenges.

## Notes

1. We do not recommend using dartpad for these challenges, as it won't show you a stacktrace with line numbers.
2. We expect you to enable [sound null-safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety)  and understand its implications. 
	You will encounter compiler warnings for null safety which you are expected to fix on your own.

## Challenges

Please complete the following challenges and drop our Technical Founder a message @ [dara.network/dev](https://dara.network/dev/) with your solution + detailed explanation video.

1. [Vertical ListView Layout](vertical_list_layout.md)
1. [Dart Typed JSON](dart_typed_json.md)
